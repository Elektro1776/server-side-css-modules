Example code as part of a thing I wrote on medium about how to use css modules on the server as well as in the client.

Running this locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the client code (to ./build/client/)
npm run build:client

# Build the server code (to ./build/server/)
npm run build:server

# Watch the for changes and rebuild client code as needed:
npm run watch:client

# Watch the for changes and rebuild server code as needed:
npm run watch:server
```
